=begin NAME

Linux::Fuxer::Procinfo - describe the process that has a file opened.

=end NAME

=begin DESCRIPTION

An array of objects of this type are returned by the method C<fuser> in
L<doc:Linux::Fuser>.  It describes a single process that has the requested
file open.

Because it has to read special files that may only be readable by the user that
owns the process it may not work as expected for users other than the superuser.

Typically objects of this type will be created as needed by C<fuser> and there
should be no need for user code to construct new objects.

=end DESCRIPTION

=begin ATTRIBUTES

There are no public methods only read-only attributes.
